    // How you call async() informs the system where you want the code to run. GCD works with a system of queues, which are much like a real-world queue: they are First In, First Out (FIFO) blocks of code. What this means is that your GCD calls don't create threads to run in, they just get assigned to one of the existing threads for GCD to manage.

    // GCD creates for you a number of queues, and places tasks in those queues depending on how important you say they are. All are FIFO, meaning that each block of code will be taken off the queue in the order they were put in, but more than one code block can be executed at the same time so the finish order isn't guaranteed.

    // The Grand Central Dispatch (GCD, or just Dispatch) framework is based on the underlying thread pool design pattern. This means that there are a fixed number of threads spawned by the system - based on some factors like CPU cores - they're always available waiting for tasks to be executed concurrently.

    // In the past a processor had one single core, it could only deal with one task at a time. Later on time-slicing was introduced, so CPU's could execute threads concurrently using context switching. As time passed by processors gained more horse power and cores so they were capable of real multi-tasking using parallelism.

    // Sync
    func load() -> String { return "" }

    // Async
    func load(completion: (String) -> Void) { completion("") }

    // On every dispatch queue, tasks will be executed in the same order as you add them to the queue - FIFO the first task in the line will be executed first - but you should note that the order of completion is not guaranteed. Tasks will be completed according to the code complexity. So if you add two tasks to the queue, a slow one first and a fast one later, the fast one can finish before the slower one.

    // Clasification
    // Serial and Concurrent queues
    // Main, Global and Custom queues
    // Main queue is Serial one
    // Global queues are system provided concurrent queues
    // It is recommended to use only custom serial queues, use global for concurrent
